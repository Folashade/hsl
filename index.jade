      | The RGB You've Been Waiting For
      | -------------------------------
    notes
      | This is a talk which I put together for the February 2016 PeninsulaJS
      | meetup. It should be digestable as a web page on its own and
      | interactive.

      | The Problem
      | ===========
    notes
      | - RGB + RGB = ðŸ¤”
      |   - Demo: Adding and subtracting RGB colors
      | - It's about adding *light* together
      |   - Demo: RGB values next to each other and the color they make (zoom
      |     in and out)
      | - Conclusion: RGB is not cool
      
    slide
      | Let's make our own color space
      | ==============================
    notes
      | - "Color space" = a system to specify a color and reason about sets of
      |   colors
      | - Analogy with Cartesian coordinates and reasoning about space
      |   - Demo: RGB as XYZ
      |   - XYZ is an ok coordinate system, but starts failing if all you care
      |     about is "How far are you from the origin?"
      | - Task: Design a system to quickly specify a color (intuitively)
      |   - How would you do that intuitively to the person sitting next to you?
      |   - Ask an attendee to describe an arbitrary color in the room
